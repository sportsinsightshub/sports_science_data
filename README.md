If you find these tutorials and the data helpful, I would greatly appreciate your support in raising funds for animal welfare in Qatar. You can donate to the cause here:

In the heart of Qatarâ€™s bustling capital city Doha, and the surrounding towns and deserts, countless stray and abandoned cats and dogs struggle to survive under harsh conditions. Their lives are a daily fight for food, water, and shelter. Often forgotten and overlooked, these innocent animals deserve a chance at a better lifeâ€”to feel safe, loved, and cared for.

All funds raised will go directly to organisations like the Qatar Animal Welfare Society (QAWS) and Pawsrescueqatar, who work tirelessly to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome these vulnerable animals. Your support can provide food, shelter, medical care, and, most importantly, a future filled with love and hope.

Thank you again for your generosity and support! ðŸ™‚ 

Regards,

Kenny McMillan / Jack Andrew
